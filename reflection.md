What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- Initially I got an issue with progrsam running without error but not printing/returning anything, I found my mistake during TA hours as I set up the constructor incorrectly by putting arguments it didn't need 

- During Office hours I changed the "inventory" type from dictionary class to list so it will be esair and more correctly regading the output type 

- Generally, task's logic wasn't hard, but I was little bit confused about the type of the different objects
